<h2 id="articles-of-incorporation-september-2002">Articles of Incorporation (September 2002)</h2>
<p>The Articles of Incorporation for Madera Community Association, Inc. are registered with the Florida Department of State. They define and establish the dedication of assets, membership, assessments, and board of directors.</p>
<h2 id="covenants-and-bylaws-october-2002-inclusion-of-phase-2-and-phase-3october-2008">Covenants and Bylaws (October 2002; inclusion of Phase 2 and Phase 3—October 2008)</h2>
<p>The Madera Community Association Covenants establish the legal framework for the Madera Community Association, are registered with Alachua County and can only be amended by two-thirds of the owners in Madera. The Covenants enable the creation of the Madera Community Association, Board of Directors (BOD) and assessments of Madera Community Association dues. They also provide for the establishment of the Architectural and Environmental Review Committee (AERC) which is charged to review architectural characteristics and landscaping of proposed and existing homes in Madera. The Covenants also identify owner obligations and restrictive covenants regarding tree removals, new construction, and amenities such as fences.</p>
<h2 id="by-laws-february-2003-inclusion-of-phase-2-and-phase-3july-2008">By-Laws (February 2003; inclusion of Phase 2 and Phase 3—July 2008)</h2>
<p>The By-Laws of Madera are approved by the Madera Board of Directors, registered with the State of Florida, and can be amended by a majority of the Board of Directors. The By-Laws provide more detail than the Covenants on the voting procedures, the annual members’ meeting requirements and the Board of Directors operations and officers. The By-Laws describe the fiscal management requirements of the BOD, and the obligations of all Madera Community Association members.</p>
<h2 id="rules-and-regulations">Rules and Regulations</h2>
<p>The BOD and AERC can develop and approve rules and regulations that establish detailed descriptions of procedures, requirements and enforcements for their responsibilities including reviews of new homes, proposed changes to homes and landscaping. As an example, the procedures may include forms and templates for new and existing homeowners to use when wanting to remove a tree or paint a house. They can also establish procedures for processing violations by builders and homeowners including fines as a last measure.</p>
<h2 id="other-related-information">Other Related Information</h2>
<p>A wide variety of information on the design and establishment of Madera is available to all homeowners. These include a list of native plant species, a list of invasive plant species, checklists, and forms for homeowners to use when considering changes to their home and landscaping, and copies of relevant Covenants, By-Laws and Rules and Regulations for Madera. Also included in this section are the Madera Community Association, Inc. annual budgets, meeting agendas and meeting minutes.</p>
