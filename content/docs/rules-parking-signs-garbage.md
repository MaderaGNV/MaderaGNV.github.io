## Vehicle Parking

Vehicles of permanent residents shall regularly be kept and parked in a garage or on a driveway and not along the street.

Vehicles may not be parked on a property in an area which is not prepared to be a driveway.

Private and commercial vehicles may not be routinely parked along the street.

Temporary street parking is allowed for residential guests and for contractors actively working at a residence.

## Recreational Vehicles and Trailers

Boats, recreational vehicles, camper trailers or other transportable personal property may not be stored for more than 48 hours in a fourteen-day period in the open parking areas or driveway. Boats, recreational vehicles, camper trailers or other transportable personal property may only be stored for longer than 48 hours in a fourteen-day period if stored within garages, behind fencing or in a manner such that they cannot be seen from the street, or in an enclosure approved by the Architectural and Environmental Review Committee (AERC).

## Commercial Vehicles

Commercial trailers, heavy equipment, or oversized vehicles (e.g., limos, semi-trailer trucks) may not be stored or parked on lots in Madera. Such vehicles belonging to contractors employed to do work on the lot in question may be parked on the street, only so long as that work is actively taking place.

## Signs

The signage placed by a homeowner or realtor may be on a property during the time the property is for sale or rent. The signage must be removed 10 days after sold/rented. Other signs must be approved by the AERC before being placed on any property. Only one builder/developer sign may be displayed on the property during construction.

## Garbage

Trash and recycling materials may be put out any time between Tuesday at 7:00am and Thursday at 5:00pm.
